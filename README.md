### Tutors involved with this project:

## On this repository:
The folder "Personal" contains the dataset. Further, you can find two Google-Colab-Notebooks "UNET_for_Audio_Image_Segmentation", which was our original model (that did not work), and the "ConvCNN_&_Densenet_for_Beatbox_Classicifation", which we programmed as an alternative. Finally, you have the pdf-file of the project report.
