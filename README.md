# Tensorflow: Final Project 
## Audio-Image Segmentation Task of Amateur Vocal Percussion Dataset

### Group members:
Niklas Bub (nbub@uni-osnabrueck.de), Tim Bax (tbax@uni-osnabrueck.de), Jasper Oldach (Joldach@uni-osnabrueck.de)

### Tutors involved with this project: 
Leon Schmid, Matthis Pink

## On this repository:
The folder "Personal" contains the dataset. Further, there are two Google-Colab-Notebooks "UNET_for_Audio_Image_Segmentation", which was our original model (that did not work), and the "ConvCNN_&_Densenet_for_Beatbox_Classicifation", which we programmed as an alternative. Our presentation video is splitted in two files (Presentation_Part_1_U-Net, Presnetation_Part_2_Conv-Net) due to our two models. Lastly, there is the pdf-file of our project report.
